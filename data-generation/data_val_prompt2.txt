We are data reviewers. Next, you will receive an audio clip, along with its description,
questions, answers, and most importantly, the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trace for solving the problem.

Your task: determine whether the CoT is a faithful, non-hallucinatory explanation that is compatible with the given
Transcript, audio_features, aligned_phonemes, Question, and Answer.

You must check all of the following:

1. Signal-faithfulness
   - Does the CoT rely only on acoustic, prosodic, and phonological evidence (pitch, energy, HNR, formants, phoneme timing/clarity, rhythm), and NOT on transcript semantics or world knowledge unrelated to the signal?
   - Does it avoid using the meaning or topic of the transcript (no inference from content/words, named entities, topics, etc.)?

2. Section discipline (if the CoT uses THINK/EVIDENCE/REASONING structure)
   - In EVIDENCE sections, does it only describe observable features (e.g., “mean pitch is low”, “consonants are clearly articulated”) without mapping them directly to labels (age/gender/dialect categories)?
   - Are label-space inferences (e.g., “middle-aged”, “adult male”, “American English”) confined to the REASONING or equivalent summary, not to EVIDENCE?

3. Hallucination and over-interpretation
   - Does the CoT avoid making claims that clearly go beyond what the given features can justify (e.g., inferring an overly specific age decade or ethnicity without strong evidence)?
   - Does it avoid fabricating numerical values, features, or patterns that are not present in the audio_features or aligned_phonemes?

4. Uncertainty and calibration
   - Does the CoT acknowledge uncertainty where appropriate, for example stating that neighboring categories could also fit or distinguishing strong vs. weak cues?
   - Does it avoid overconfident language suggesting a deterministic mapping from features to a very narrow label when the evidence is weak or ambiguous?

5. Consistency with the provided Answer
   - The final label/category in the CoT (and in the RESPONSE) should match the provided Answer.
   - However, even if the Answer matches, the CoT must still be rejected if the reasoning is clearly unfaithful, hallucinatory, or violates the constraints above.

Output format (MUST follow exactly):

- If the CoT is acceptable (faithful, non-hallucinatory, respects the rules above), output:

<True>
[Short explanation (2–5 sentences) of why it is acceptable, referencing the checklist above.]

- If the CoT is NOT acceptable (contains hallucinations, rule violations, or serious over-interpretation), output:

<False>
[Short explanation (2–8 sentences) of the specific problems, referencing the checklist above. Be concrete about where it over-interprets, hallucinates, or uses forbidden information.]

Now, here is the data to evaluate:

aligned_phonemes: [aligned_phonemes]
Question: [Question]
Answer: [Answer]
CoT Trace: [CoT]

Please conduct a thorough judgment and analysis and provide the result in the specified format.
