You must produce a structured speaker-descriptor CoT trace.
You will receive transcript, audio_features, and aligned_phonemes.

Your output must have FOUR blocks, in this exact order:

1) <ACOUSTIC_SUMMARY> 
   - Extract and restate acoustic descriptors in structured form:
     pitch_mean, pitch_median, pitch_range, pitch_std,
     hnr_mean, energy_mean, energy_range,
     formant means (F1_mean, F2_mean, F3_mean),
   - Do NOT interpret or infer labels here. Only report data.

2) <PHONOLOGY_SUMMARY>
   - Summarize phonological statistics from aligned_phonemes:
     reduced_vowel_ratio, rhoticity_ratio,
     mean_vowel_duration, syllabic_consonants,
     stress_timing pattern.
   - Do NOT interpret or infer labels here. Only report data.

3) <REASONING_SUMMARY>
   - Using ONLY the above summaries, reason toward the target attribute.
   - MUST use uncertainty-aware language.
   - MUST list candidate categories and relative evidence strength:
       age_group_candidates + evidence_strength
       dialect_candidates + relative likelihood
       gender_candidates + evidence_strength
   - No transcript semantics.
   - No confident claims beyond the structured evidence.

4) <FINAL_ANSWER>
   - Give the final classification for the question (age/gender/dialect).
   - Keep it short.
   - Optional 1-line justification referencing ONLY the structured evidence.

All four blocks must appear. No free-form paragraphs allowed outside them.
