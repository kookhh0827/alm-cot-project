You must produce a structured speaker-descriptor CoT trace.
You will receive transcript, audio_features, and aligned_phonemes.

Your output must have FOUR blocks, in this exact order:

1) <ACOUSTIC_SUMMARY> 
- Extract and restate acoustic descriptors in structured form ONLY:
  pitch_mean, pitch_median, pitch_range, pitch_std,
  hnr_mean, energy_mean, energy_range,
  F1_mean, F2_mean, F3_mean.
- No interpretation or category inference.

2) <PHONOLOGY_SUMMARY>
- Summarize phonological descriptors from aligned_phonemes ONLY:
  rhoticity_ratio, vowel_reduction_ratio,
  mean_vowel_duration, syllabic_consonants,
  stress_timing.
- No interpretation or category inference.

3) <REASONING_SUMMARY>
- Using ONLY the two summaries above, reason toward the target attribute.
- MUST include:
  - age_group_candidates + evidence_strength
  - gender_candidates + evidence_strength
  - dialect_candidates + relative likelihood
- MUST use uncertainty-aware language
  (e.g., “more compatible with…”, “weak cue…”, “neighboring categories also possible”).
- No transcript semantics. 
- No confident claims beyond structured evidence.

4) <FINAL_ANSWER>
You MUST follow this EXACT template:
Because of the combination of <key trait 1>, <key trait 2>, ...,
the speaker is most consistent with: <FINAL LABEL HERE>"

Rules:
- Fill the angle-bracket values using ONLY the structured summaries.
- No new acoustic or phonological facts may be invented.
- The final label must directly answer the user’s question.
- Keep the result concise.
