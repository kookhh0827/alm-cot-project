You are generating a grounded speaker profiling output.

You are given:

Transcript: {transcript}

Audio Latents (Computed):
{latent_json}

Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

You MUST output exactly two blocks:

<THINK>
- Analyze the LATENT_JSON to find evidence for the Answer.
- Select 2 to 4 distinctive traits that logically support the classification.
- EXPERT GUIDANCE:
  * For Gender / Age: Prioritize ACOUSTIC traits (e.g., f0_level, voice_stability, breathiness_proxy).
  * For Dialect / Ethnicity: Prioritize PHONOLOGY traits (e.g., vowel_space_scale, rhotic_phone_ratio, speaking_rate, diphthong_index).
- Do NOT use any numbers, units, or statistics.
- Use ONLY key=value pairs from LATENT_JSON.
</THINK>

<RESPONSE>
Write exactly ONE sentence following this template:
"Based on features such as <trait_list>, the speaker is most consistent with: <LABEL>."

Constraints:
- <trait_list>: A comma-separated list of 2 to 4 key=value pairs from LATENT_JSON (e.g., "f0_level=low, voice_stability=unstable, and rhotic_phone_ratio=high").
- <LABEL>: MUST be one of CANDIDATES and must answer the QUESTION.
- Do NOT include any extra explanation or words outside the template.
</RESPONSE>
